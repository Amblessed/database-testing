A Stored function is a special kind of stored program that returns a single value

**Stored Procedure vs Stored Function**
- The stored function must return a value but in Stored Procedure it is optional
- Even a procedure can return zero or n values
- Functions can have only input parameters for it whereas Procedures can have input or output parameters
- Functions can be called from Procedure whereas Procedures cannot be called from a function
